# QR_Embed
My QR_Code generator, free to use

This is a QR Code Generator (thanks to [ Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library) for the QR Code part) written in C++ that uses OpenCV to go from a simple sad QR Code into a much better one.
All it takes is : 
- Your text input
- The image that you want (relative path)
- The name of the output that you want, which is a .jpg.

[Here is an example](equi.jpg)
